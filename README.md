**nekStab** is a toolbox to conduct bifurcation analyses using the spectral element CFD solver [Nek5000](https://github.com/Nek5000/Nek5000).
It is released under the ??? licence.

The project started in 2010 with the PhD thesis of [Jean-Christophe Loiseau](https://loiseaujc.github.io/) and is build on top of the work of former PhD students of our group such as Frédéric Alizard, Stefania Cherubini, Alessandro Bucci, Mirko Farano, Francesco Picella and [Ricardo Frantz](https://github.com/ricardofrantz).
Ricardo is the one responsible for having brought together all the previous contributions into a single toolbox.

It is actively maintained primarily by [Ricardo Frantz](https://github.com/ricardofrantz) and [Jean-Christophe Loiseau](https://loiseaujc.github.io/).
Both of them work at [DynFluid](http://dynfluid.ensam.eu/), a fluid dynamics laboratory part of [Arts et Métiers Institute of Technology](https://artsetmetiers.fr/en).
